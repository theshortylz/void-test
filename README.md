Void Test

This project is a backend application that provides three endpoints to consume data from an external API and store it in a database. The application allows users to query information about League of Legends players, such as their summoner details, match history, and leaderboard rankings. The retrieved data is then saved in a local database for efficient access and future reference. With these endpoints, users can easily access and manage player data for further analysis or display.
